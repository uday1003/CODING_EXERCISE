Definition:
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions throughout the system.

Scenario:
In the context of a log manager that ensures only one instance handles logs across the system, the singleton pattern guarantees that all log operations are managed by the same instance of the log manager. This prevents the duplication of log managers and ensures consistent logging behavior.

Key Components:
Singleton Class (LogManager):
This class contains a private static instance of itself and restricts object instantiation to ensure only one instance exists.
It provides a getInstance() method to access the single instance and offers methods to log messages.
Advantages:
Controlled Access: The singleton pattern provides controlled access to the single instance, ensuring that no additional instances can be created.
Resource Management: By limiting the instantiation of the class, the singleton pattern helps in efficient resource management, especially in scenarios like logging, caching, or database connections.
Consistency: Singleton ensures that there is a consistent state throughout the application as there is only one instance handling the core responsibility.
Implementation Overview:
In this example, the LogManager class ensures only one instance is created by checking if the instance is null. If it is, it creates a new instance, otherwise, it returns the existing instance. The logging functionality is provided via the log() method.

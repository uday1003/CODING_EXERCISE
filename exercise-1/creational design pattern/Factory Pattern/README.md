Definition:
The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects without exposing the exact class being instantiated. It delegates the responsibility of object creation to subclasses or specialized factory methods. This pattern is particularly useful when the exact types of objects need to be determined during runtime.

Scenario:
In the context of a vehicle factory that creates different types of vehicles (car, bike, truck), the factory pattern is employed to encapsulate the logic of object creation. This allows the client to request different types of vehicles (e.g., car, bike) without knowing the internal details of the instantiation process.

Key Components:
Product (Vehicle Interface):

Declares the common interface for all products (vehicles). Each concrete vehicle type (car, bike, truck) implements this interface.
Concrete Products (Car, Bike Classes):

These classes represent specific types of products (e.g., Car, Bike), each implementing the Vehicle interface.
Factory (VehicleFactory Class):

This class defines a method (getVehicle()) to create different types of vehicles based on the input parameter. The factory encapsulates the instantiation logic, so the client doesnâ€™t need to worry about which class to instantiate.
Advantages:
Decoupling: The factory pattern decouples the object creation from the client code, allowing for easier code maintenance and future extensions.
Flexibility: The factory can create any number of new vehicle types by simply adding new classes, without modifying existing code.
Centralized Object Creation: Centralizing the object creation logic in the factory class makes the codebase easier to manage.
Implementation Overview:
In this example, the VehicleFactory class decides which concrete class to instantiate (either Car or Bike) based on the input string. The getVehicle() method hides the complexity of object creation from the client and returns a Vehicle object.

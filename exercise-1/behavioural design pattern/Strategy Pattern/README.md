Definition:
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms or behaviors and makes them interchangeable within an object. The client can choose from a variety of strategies at runtime, and the algorithm selected will be executed without the client needing to understand the specifics of the implementation.

Scenario:
In the context of an e-commerce system that allows customers to choose different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal), the strategy pattern allows the payment processing method to be dynamically selected by the customer. This decouples the payment logic from the shopping cart, making the system more extensible.

Key Components:
Strategy (PaymentStrategy Interface):

Declares an interface for different payment methods that can be used by the client. Each payment method (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal) implements the PaymentStrategy interface.
Concrete Strategy (CreditCardPayment, PaypalPayment):

Implements the actual payment processing for a specific payment method. For example, CreditCardPayment processes the payment using a credit card, while PaypalPayment processes the payment via PayPal.
Context (ShoppingCart):

The shopping cart holds a reference to a PaymentStrategy object. At runtime, the client sets the payment method, and the shopping cart uses that strategy to complete the payment during checkout.
Advantages:
Extensibility: New payment methods can be added without modifying the existing code. You just need to implement a new strategy.
Maintainability: The payment logic is decoupled from the main logic of the shopping cart, making the system more maintainable.
Flexibility: The system allows customers to choose from multiple payment methods, which can be selected dynamically during runtime.
Implementation Overview:
In the provided code, the PaymentStrategy interface defines a pay() method that each payment method must implement. The ShoppingCart class serves as the context, which uses the selected payment strategy to complete the checkout process. At runtime, the user can select between CreditCardPayment or PaypalPayment, and the payment will be processed accordingly.

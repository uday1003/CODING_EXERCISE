Definition:
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together. This is useful when a class needs to use an existing class with an interface that doesnâ€™t match what it requires.

Scenario:
An adapter for a third-party payment gateway is needed in a system that originally uses an old payment gateway but wants to integrate a new payment system. The Adapter Pattern allows the system to use the old gateway by adapting it to the new interface expected by the new payment system.

Key Components:
Target Interface (NewPaymentGateway Interface):

Defines the interface that the client expects (e.g., makePayment()).
Adaptee (OldPaymentGateway Class):

This is the existing class that needs to be adapted to work with the new interface (e.g., processTransaction()).
Adapter (PaymentAdapter Class):

The adapter class implements the target interface and adapts the Adaptee by internally calling the old interface methods, allowing it to work with the new system.
Advantages:
Compatibility: The adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together without modifying the original class.
Reusability: It allows the reuse of existing functionality in a new system by converting an existing class into a compatible interface.
Flexibility: Adapters allow for more flexible and extensible code, as they help systems evolve without needing to change the core components.
Implementation Overview:
In this payment system scenario, the OldPaymentGateway represents the old way of processing payments. The PaymentAdapter class adapts it to the NewPaymentGateway interface, allowing the old gateway to be used with the new payment process.
